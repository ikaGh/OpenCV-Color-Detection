# OpenCV-Color-Detection

Developed a function to determine the HSV color limits for any specified BGR color, accommodating hue wrap-around for specific hues.
Implemented a script to capture live video feed, convert frames to HSV, and apply a mask to detect specified color objects.
Generated a binary mask, identified the bounding box of the detected object, and drew it on the live video feed in real time.
